What is an IRC Bot?

A bot is a virtual assistant that emulates a real user to provide instant responses. IRC bot is a type of network client that could be a script or a program that can relay messages using the IRC protocol.

When any active user receives a text from the IRC bot, it appears to him as another real user.


What can a Bot do?

The bots mimic a real user and communicate with other active clients. However, they can perform a variety of tasks:

    Archive chat messages
    Can parse Twitter feeds
    Crawl the web for a keyword
    Run any command if needed
